        <h4 class="Education">Education</h4>
    <p class="A"> I’m currently studying at the Artificial Intelligence Faculty of Kafrelsheikh University,
        where I’m diving into AI and its endless possibilities.
        My studies inspire me to integrate AI concepts into web development.
        My coursework includes machine learning, data analysis, and AI technologies, 
        which complement my web development skills.</p>

<p class="B"><span class="Special">Web Development Intern      Prodigy InfoTech (September/2024) -Present</span>                       
    <br>   At Prodigy InfoTech, I work on real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and Java.

    <br>
<p class="C">My journey into web development began with a passion for working with data.
    However, I quickly realized that data alone isn't enough to create meaningful impact; it needs to be presented in an interactive and engaging way.
    This insight led me to pursue web development, where I could combine my love for data with the creativity of building user-friendly interfaces. By starting this journey from the very beginning, 
    I aimed to master the skills needed to create dynamic and visually appealing websites that effectively communicate data-driven insights.</p>
